- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @vannyzim, from Guarulhos, SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. 
- IÂ´m actually getting a bachelors degree on a law school here, but i am really interested in coding and programming, when i was a kid, i really wanted to make a game and things like that, but never put effort in it until 27/06/22;
- Still figuring out what coding language i want to learn but starting with HTML5 and CSS3.
- I would be more than glad to get hints and chat about it.
